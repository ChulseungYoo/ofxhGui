ofxhGui is a graphical user interface used as an openFrameworks add-on.

Current version: 1.04
Works with OF versions 0062, 007, 0071, 0072, 0073 and 0074
and has been tested on Mac OS X, Windows and Ubuntu

If you are using OF version 0.7.4, you have to make some little changes in order to display colors and text correctly.
Please read the warning bellow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ofxhGui has following widgets :

- panels (can be nested)

- tabs to show different panels (also available in nested panels)

- labels, buttons, checkboxes, radio-buttons, sliders, 2D sliders, number boxes

- listboxes(scrollable), button boxes, editable text (single or multi-lines/scrollable)

- modeless dialogs

More widgets will be add in future versions.

Note:
- changing the text insertion point and scrolling works on hTextArea (multi-line text) but not on hTextBox (single line text).

- the arrow keys don't work actually on hTextArea and hTextBox.
This will be addressed in future versions

There is a default set of colors that can be modified. Fonts can also be changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The addon ofxhGui depends on:

- ofxhUtils (please take the last version)

- ofxXmlSettings (already in the addons folder of openFrameworks)

It is also necessary to have a folder called 'fonts' in the data folder
where the gui can search the needed fonts.

The example files can be used as a tutorial for ofxhGui

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning for OF 0.7.4 users:
In OF 0.7.4, the macro OF_VERSION in no longer defined.

The following macros are used instead :
#define OF_VERSION_MAJOR 0
#define OF_VERSION_MINOR 7
#define OF_VERSION_PATCH 4

In order to work correctly, in the following files, 
all occurrences of OF_VERSION have to be replaced by OF_VERSION_MINOR :

hDrawingPrimitives.cpp
hTextArea.cpp
hTextBox.cpp

in hGui.cpp, all occurrences of OF_VERSION_MINOR < 1 have to be replaced by OF_VERSION_MINOR < 7
----------------------------------------------------------------------
